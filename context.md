
1. User authentication:
   - Students create accounts with: name, school name, class, email, password
   - Login with email and password

2. After login:
   - Students see sections A, B, C, D, E, F of their respective class
   - They can select a section (e.g., 10 D)

3. After selecting a section:
   - Students can search for notes by title or date
   - Students can upload notes (PDF/JPEG/PNG)
   - When uploading, they need to enter their name

4. Additional features:
   - All uploaded notes are available to everyone
   - Community section for different classes

5. Technology stack:
   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   - Backend: Supabase (authentication, database, storage)

I should create a new web application project with these components:

1. Authentication pages (signup, login)
2. Dashboard to show classes and sections
3. Section page with search and upload functionality
4. Community section
